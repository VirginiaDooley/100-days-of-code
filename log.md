### Day 8: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent all day working on the nested forms lab. I wasn't clear if I should include a database - it's seemed like a challenge but then I got stuck on tests. Now that I am well into it, I need to spend more time figuring out whether to remove the db to satisfy tests or if there is a solution. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1084870617382510592)

**Thoughts**: Regardless of where I got stuck, I took the opportunity to document (in a blog post) the process of building a Sinatra app w database which allowed me to pull together bits of knowledge from the course to date. Feeling annoyed I didn't finish but confident after the review.

### Day 9: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I stepped away from the previous nested forms lab to work on another nested forms lab hoping it would provide some insight into where I was getting stuck. I realised that my form labels and input name needed to match to pass tests. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1085471685933961216)

**Thoughts**: Yet again, I ended up saving myself some time and frustration by taking a break and looking at it with fresh eyes. I love the challenge so much that taking a break when I get stuck is especially difficult, but always rewarding (and necessary) in the end!

### Day 10: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I worked on a CRUD lab which reinforced my understanding of databases, including creating tables and migrations. I wasn't able to finish, despite my best efforts, due to a test that really *should* be passing, but just isn't. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1085589903948304386)

**Thoughts**: I may have to call in reinforcements on this one. I've checked my code ten times over and don't know where I'm off.

### Day 11: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished the Sinatra CRUD Lab. The reason I got stuck was due to a syntax error where I included an @ in an iteration on index.erb where it shouldn't exist. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1085848543913562117)

**Thoughts**: Victory is mine! A good night's sleep made all the difference.

### Day 12: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I learned about helper methods and first steps of user authentication. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1086226277936312320)

**Thoughts**: !! needed some research and it turns out that a redirect can essentially stop an if statement from going further (hence not needing an else). I think months ago, my solution to this would have looked much longer and definitely not DRY. Progress!

### Day 13: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This lab was pretty straightforward practice in Sinatra CRUD and Restful Routes. I did have to research how to iterate and display links which I haven't done since the Web Scraper/CLI Project [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1086630625916919808)

**Thoughts**: I completely over thought the complexity of displaying links - a good reminder to test the simplest code first.

### Day 14: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started Sinatra Complex Forms Associations today but plan to finish it over the course of a couple days and review video lectures in between. Among all that I've learned this week, it's the importance of taking breaks to increase efficiency.  [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1087087410696151041)

**Thoughts**: Having run a Shopify store in the past, I'm pretty excited to see the evolution of e-commerce MVC. The experience of managing CRMs and online shops makes these labs easier to get through and absorb newer concepts.
