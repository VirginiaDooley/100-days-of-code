### Day 8: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent all day working on the nested forms lab. I wasn't clear if I should include a database - it's seemed like a challenge but then I got stuck on tests. Now that I am well into it, I need to spend more time figuring out whether to remove the db to satisfy tests or if there is a solution. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1084870617382510592)

**Thoughts**: Regardless of where I got stuck, I took the opportunity to document (in a blog post) the process of building a Sinatra app w database which allowed me to pull together bits of knowledge from the course to date. Feeling annoyed I didn't finish but confident after the review.

### Day 9: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I stepped away from the previous nested forms lab to work on another nested forms lab hoping it would provide some insight into where I was getting stuck. I realised that my form labels and input name needed to match to pass tests. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1085471685933961216)

**Thoughts**: Yet again, I ended up saving myself some time and frustration by taking a break and looking at it with fresh eyes. I love the challenge so much that taking a break when I get stuck is especially difficult, but always rewarding (and necessary) in the end!

### Day 10: January 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I worked on a CRUD lab which reinforced my understanding of databases, including creating tables and migrations. I wasn't able to finish, despite my best efforts, due to a test that really *should* be passing, but just isn't. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1085589903948304386)

**Thoughts**: I may have to call in reinforcements on this one. I've checked my code ten times over and don't know where I'm off.

### Day 11: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished the Sinatra CRUD Lab. The reason I got stuck was due to a syntax error where I included an @ in an iteration on index.erb where it shouldn't exist. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1085848543913562117)

**Thoughts**: Victory is mine! A good night's sleep made all the difference.

### Day 12: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I learned about helper methods and first steps of user authentication. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1086226277936312320)

**Thoughts**: !! needed some research and it turns out that a redirect can essentially stop an if statement from going further (hence not needing an else). I think months ago, my solution to this would have looked much longer and definitely not DRY. Progress!

### Day 13: January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: This lab was pretty straightforward practice in Sinatra CRUD and Restful Routes. I did have to research how to iterate and display links which I haven't done since the Web Scraper/CLI Project [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1086630625916919808)

**Thoughts**: I completely over thought the complexity of displaying links - a good reminder to test the simplest code first.

### Day 14: January 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started Sinatra Complex Forms Associations today but plan to finish it over the course of a couple days and review video lectures in between. Among all that I've learned this week, it's the importance of taking breaks to increase efficiency.  [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1087087410696151041)

**Thoughts**: Having run a Shopify store in the past, I'm pretty excited to see the evolution of e-commerce MVC. The experience of managing CRMs and online shops makes these labs easier to get through and absorb newer concepts.

### Day 15: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I completed the MVC for half of the app and now onto the next. Since I've started Flatiron Labs, I've been focused on testing and submitting but haven't been great about git commits and demonstrating progress. That changes today! [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1087414497906700293)

**Thoughts**: Our specs for the Sinatra final project were released today and I'm excited to get my hands dirty with some original code!

### Day 16: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started building my app for my final Sinatra project using ActiveRecord. I used the corneal gem to set up the initial scaffolding and environment and made my edits from there. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1087414497906700293)

**Thoughts**: I went to codebar this evening to get help debugging as needed, but I didn't run into any major issues. In the end, I used most of the time to build out the User model. I'm so grateful to have the lifeline to codebar mentors when I get stuck.

### Day 17: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I completed the User model and controllers and made it half way through my Actions model and controllers as well as worked on a few views to complete User registration and login. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1088129475848613894)

**Thoughts**: I've been committing often but learned today that I am supposed to use the present tense in my commits. I'll remember that going forward, but will keep to the same tense for the remainder of this project.

### Day 18: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: After completing my basic CRUD routes, I added a bit of styling to make things pretty. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1088564279291330560)

**Thoughts**: Every now and then I need to switch gears and focus on design. The quick shift to CSS was a therapeutic break.

### Day 19: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I'm completely stuck on model association and I'm not sure why. However, I've managed to fine tune my user flow on other routes. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1088831801534152704)

**Thoughts**: I've clearly missed something along the way. I stopped to map my models out once again to confirm my understanding. Back at it tomorrow with fresh eyes.

### Day 20: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finally fixed the associations between my models. It turns out I was trying to associate models with a foreign key after creation not realising this was already done and I was calling it incorrectly in my views. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1089168516681478144)

**Thoughts**: I need to take more time reading through the resources provided in my labs. I missed a small but crucial element of associations and will learn from this.

### Day 21: January 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my update routes today but I'm still seeing some association errors that I thought were resolved. I need to investigate further with fresh eyes. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1089616131994935296)

**Thoughts**: I might have an error in my tables. I'm going to watch a few videos and start fresh.

### Day 22: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I fixed my routes and forms to be able to show, edit and update actions dynamically. Next, onto delete routes and forms. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1089868875410407424)

**Thoughts**: I deleted my databases and started fresh once I realised there was an error in my tables! My foreign key was a different data type than I wanted and I had dozens of incorrect records. I'm feeling pretty pumped that I figured this out and resolved several related bugs on my own.

### Day 23: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I finalised all my CRUD routes for my Sinatra app. I didn't add the ability to edit user password but will look into that as time allows.  [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1090319096779022338)

### Day 24: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I added bcrypt validations and refactored related routes in my controllers. I also added a flash message which took me a while because it turns out the gem I originally tried was down. I ended up using rack-flash3 which was easy to implement. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1090560246127439872)

**Thoughts**: I love using helpers, it makes my code much cleaner.

### Day 25: January 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today, I added bootstrap styling to forms and revamped the home page with some very basic nav. I am going to research how to present the user with certain options if logged_in? etc. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1090560246127439872)

**Thoughts**: I've been using bootstrap for years but never really took the time to read through the documentation. Understanding the grid system really is essential to unleashing all the power of bootstrap!

### Day 26: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on navigation and spent the day testing my routes. I've spotted a few bugs that need attention before I submit.  [Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1091340296158367746)

**Thoughts**: There are still a few things that are unclear. I need to research redirect vs direct erb rendering and my flash messages are only appearing in some views.

### Day 27: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: It's complete! My first full app from 'scratch'.[Tweet](https://twitter.com/vcdooley/status/1091737915980423168)

**Thoughts**: I worked with my pair partner today which was super helpful for both of us. We reinforced our understanding of certain terms and functions.
