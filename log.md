### Day 8: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent all day working on the nested forms lab. I wasn't clear if I should include a database - it's seemed like a challenge but then I got stuck on tests. Now that I am well into it, I need to spend more time figuring out whether to remove the db to satisfy tests or if there is a solution.

**Thoughts**: Regardless of where I got stuck, I took the opportunity to document (in a blog post) the process of building a Sinatra app w database which allowed me to pull together bits of knowledge from the course to date. Feeling annoyed I didn't finish but confident after the review.

### Day 8: January 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I stepped away from the previous nested forms lab to work on another nested forms lab hoping it would provide some insight into where I was getting stuck. spent all day working on the nested forms lab. I wasn't clear if I should include a database - it's seemed like a challenge but then I got stuck on tests. Now that I am well into it, I need to spend more time figuring out whether to remove the db to satisfy tests or if there is a solution.

**Thoughts**: Yet again, I ended up saving myself some time and frustration by taking a break and looking at it with fresh eyes. I love the challenge so much that taking a break when I get stuck is especially difficult, but always rewarding (and necessary) in the end!
